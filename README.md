Double-click the Basic Scene (Assets-Scenes-Basic), and you can add your own textures and run the AdaIN model.

# TTS (Target Texture to Screen Scene)

Double-click the TTS Scene (Assets-Scenes-TTS). This scene is designed to use the camera's target texture as the **content input**, and you can render the output to the screen. However, please note that there are some indexing issues because PyTorch usually uses CHW instead of CWH.

- Known Issues:
  - Output resolution is fixed at **512x512**. If you want a different resolution, it would be better to export the ONNX file's shape like this, for example: FullHD (1080x1920). You can edit PyTorch codes or reshape inputs & output tensors using [ShallowReshape](https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.sentis@1.1/manual/do-basic-tensor-operations.html#reshape-a-tensor).
  - The camera needs to be rotated typically **Â±180** following the Z-axis.
