# Barracuda_AdaIN

Special Thanks to Sky Kim by visiting [Sky's github](https://github.com/skykim). You can see his fancy projects.

Origianl Model : [naoto0804 / pytorch-AdaIN](https://github.com/naoto0804/pytorch-AdaIN)

All needed files are added on "Asset" folder. As an example I set 4 styles. Inference script is attached to GameManager object and by using drag and drop you can change the contens and styles.

If you want to edit code. I highly recommend import styles to "Resources" folder and edit the enum field (style_list).
