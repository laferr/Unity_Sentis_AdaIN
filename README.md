A special thanks to Sky Kim. Visit [Sky's github](https://github.com/skykim).

Origianl Model : [naoto0804 / pytorch-AdaIN](https://github.com/naoto0804/pytorch-AdaIN)

All necessary files have been added to the "Assets" folder. Four styles have been set up as examples. The inference script is attached to the GameManager object, allowing you to change contents and styles using drag and drop.

If you want to edit the code, we highly recommend importing styles into the "Resources" folder and editing the enum field (style_list).
